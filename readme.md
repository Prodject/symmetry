# Symmetry

The purpose of this is to create a consistent bash experience across multiple devices that run bash; MacOS, Ubuntu, Raspbian, Windows 10 (WSL).

This is a WIP and is how I set up my systems but could be used for your systems.

Run the system application install
```
$ symmetry install
```

Run the initialization scripts (this happens automatically when bootstrapped):
```
$ symmetry init
```
